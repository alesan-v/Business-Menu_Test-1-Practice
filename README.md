Was given a prompt to create a basic menu screen that offered a user 4 different options: Payroll information, order information, monthly profits, and Quit.
Employee payroll took in the number of employee's and their hours in order to give out wages.
Customer order processor took in amounts and prices of orders to give discounts and totals.
Monthly profits decides if a profit or loss was made and how much it was.
The program should run over again until the user doesn't want to, program breaks when user wants to quit.
Very Basic.
